WELCOME!!...AND THANK YOU FOR VISITING THIS PROJECT

THIS IS MY FIRST PROJECT AND I NOT ONLY WELCOME COLLABORATORS (SHOULD YOU WISH TO GET INVOLVED),
I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO ANY FEEDBACK ON HOW TO IMPROVE THINGS.

THIS PROJECT IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT YET COMPLETE

A Rust library designed to directly calculate the reciprocal gamma function using a modified version of Spouge's
approximation for the gamma function.
The inputs for the Spouge approximation are a complex number z, and the Spouge parameter 'a'.
The Spouge parameter is an integer greater than 2.
